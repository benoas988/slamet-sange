                    <p>This EVCS is our first project. It has been filled with struggles and tears. Through this EVCS, we have discovered the true mindset of an engineer. We express our heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Agus Mukhlisin S.T.,M.T for teaching us to strive and never give up.
                        <br>Even though our knowledge was minimal at that time, we remained enthusiastic because we knew that extraordinary results require a challenging process. Since the beginning of this project, we kept on learning and learning to develop our hardware, firmware, and software skills. Our orientation shifted from just being university students to become experts in our concentration. We love discussing our area of expertise anywhere and anytime. This EVCS is a tangible proof of our struggle, and we believe it will lead us to become great engineers in the future.</p>

                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>This is our first self-made electric car, at the same time, we became the first team from UNAIR to develop an electric car. We built it from zero with our own hands, utilizing basic tools and materials, as well as the support from UNAIR and FTMM, to develop this electric car. The car was created with the goal of participating in the prestigious event called Shell Eco-Marathon. Our team was very solid and enthusiastic, even though we didn't have much knowledge at that time. We diligently studied until this car was created."
                        <br>The interesting thing is that we started building this car since September 2022, but one month before the competition, we started over. We rebuilt it in less than a month, precisely within just 3 weeks. With determination and lots of coffee, we reconstructed the car. The journey wasn't entirely smooth; as the competition date approached, we faced challenges with our controller, which malfunctioned several times, requiring us to replace components and even rebuild it from scratch. In total, we replaced components 5 times and rebuilt it 4 times, but that's okay. As beginners, we are quite proud of our work.</p>
